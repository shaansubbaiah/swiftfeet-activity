Swift Feet:
Sugarized by Daniel Drake

This content was extracted from the Swift Feet flash activity included
in the original The Belinda Stronach Foundation (TBSF, OLPC Canada)
AdobeAir-based activity.

The videos were already present on-disk in flv format, I converted them to
Theora with:
	# ffmpeg2theora -x 688 -y 448 --videoquality 8 --noaudio --optimize

The thumbnails were extracted from the flash files by Adam Gordon using
software on a Mac. A handful had to be extracted as screenshots.

The music and audio instructions were extracted from the original flash
file using swfextract and re-encoded as ogg with:
	# mplayer -ao pcm "$i" -ao pcm:file="$name.wav"
	# oggenc --downmix $name.wav

The music files had to have some silence removed from the start and end
so that they loop well.

The textual content was copy/pasted from the contents.txt file shipped
with the flash version.

At the time of writing, XO-1.75 cannot play the music and audio instructions
at the same time (it is limited to playing one sound at a time). So, on
XO-1.75, the audio instructions play first, then the music starts after.
